                                            far the lightest of any plumbing system. Its specific

                                            of steel and cast iron. Three meter length pipes are
                                            easily carried. Because of its lightness in weight,
                                            it is easy to transport, handle and install, especially
                                            in tight places. It is also highly resistant to sunlight

                                            are not affected by the climate and can be installed

                                            that accommodates the special BLUEBELL PIPE-SEAL RUBBER

                                            done by pushing the spigot end of the pipe into the
                                            socket end of the nest pipe to make a watertight joint.
                                            The color of the pipe is blue.

                                            for working pressure up to 1.2 MPa. The extruded uPVC
                                            pipe has a smooth inner wall which provides a low resistance,
